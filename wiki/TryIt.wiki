==Architecture Graph Example==

The ArchitectureGraph class that can be run by checking out the source code in your IDE creates an example of an architecture graph. The blocks in the graph are created programmatically and the layout of the blocks are handled by Swing layout managers. The position of the blocks and additional graphic elements that are created from resources files can be manually adjusted in the GUI by dragging around the elements. The resulting layout is saved in a properties file. The graph is inspired by [http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/images/javase.gif JavaSE architecture graph].
